To run the game , run the resulting exe,
in this case Arkanoid.exe. Do not forget that Ctrl-F1 enables you to view  inners of the system to run just enter "Arkanoid.exe"
in the dosbox.

Arkanoid game in DoxBox Using XINU .

You have to install dosbox to run the exe file : https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1
You have to install XINU OS to compile the c file  : http://math.haifa.ac.il/~oscourse/index_files/xinu4win.exe
You have to install the game and save it on XINU4WIN\NEWSRC\ArkanoidGame
Compile a game :
Lets say you would like to compile one of the examples in
XINU4WIN\NEWSRC\EXAMPLES, ex5.c for instance.
if you want to run the exe file you can do : 
    Open a DOSBOX window, and after this write :-
    mount c c:\
    c:
    then go to the folder of the game and run Arkanoid.exe 
if you want to compile the code Arkanoid.c you can install Xinu :- 
    Open a DOSBOX window, and after this write :-
    mount c c:\
    c:     
Use the "path" command to include tc\bin in your path, for instance:
    path c:\tc\bin 

    cd XINU4WIN\NEWSRC\FileName 
    
    and then :
    tcc -I.. Arkanoid.c ..\XINU.LIB 
    Arkanoid.exe
NOTE !! 
To check the compilation and error messages run
 tcc -I.. Arkanoid.c ..\XINU.LIB > errs
type errs



The "> errs" is solely in order not to lose the doskey abilities of the 
command window. Due to some bug the turbo linker disables this.

To run the application, run the resulting exe, in this case Arkanoid.exe.
Do not forget that Ctrl-F1 enables you to view  inners of the system
to run just enter "Arkanoid.exe" in the dosbox.
